\section{Fonts, Sizes and Colors}
When creating text fields in the \giraf software suite, is it imperative that they look alike across the entire suite. For this reason one should at all times use the default font-type in the applications. \\

\noindent The size of any text across the applications should always be given in ``SP'', and should always be readable on both 7 and 10 inch tablets. It is up to the developers of the individual applications to decide upon a specific text-size, but it should fit the general layout of the suite. \\

\noindent All text should by default be black (\#000000) across the suite when placed in buttons, views, etc. When creating hint text, e.g. when there are no applications present in the launcher, one should use the android implementation of Darker Gray\footnote{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.color.html\#darker\_gray}. When using the showcase library to highlight features, the text color of the help text should be white (\#FFFFFF), so it is readable on the dark background.
