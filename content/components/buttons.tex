\label{cha:buttons}

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Describe Buttons (GirafButtons):} Talk about when to use text, when to use icons, when to use both, and where to place positive and negative actions in a layout. Android Standard says that positive action buttons should be to the right and negative should be to the left. For instance Deny-button to the left and Confirm-button to the right}

\todo[inline]{Refer to the appendix (Usage of GirafButtons) that describes how one uses the GirafButton class implemented in the GirafComponents. This appendix might not be done yet.}
