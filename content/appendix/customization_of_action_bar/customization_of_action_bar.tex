If one wants to customize the action bar, the \androidinline{GirafActivity} provides the possibility to change the title of the action bar and the possibility of adding \androidinline{GirafButton}s to the action bar. The action bar looks like the one in \figrefpage{fig:top_bar_example}. 

\begin{note}
    This actionbar is only available to activities that extends the \androidinline{GirafActivity}.
\end{note}

\noindent
From default the title in the top bar is the label of the application, how ever if one wants to customize it the \androidinline{setActionBarTitle} method can be used as seen in \lstrefline{lst:customized_action_bar}{line:actionbar:title}.

The action bar always have a back button shown that does the same as the standard android back button. If one wants to add more buttons to the action bar one can use the \androidinline{addGirafButtonToActionBar} method. One can then instantiate some \androidinline{GirafButton}s and then use this method as in \lstreflines{lst:customized_action_bar}{line:actionbar:buttonstart}{line:actionbar:buttonend}
